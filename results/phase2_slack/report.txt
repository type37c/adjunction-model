Phase 2 Slack Preservation Experiment Report
================================================================================

## Training Configuration

- Number of epochs: 2
- Final loss: 0.6467
- Final affordance loss: 0.5484

## Slack Analysis

### Unit η (Shape Slack)

- Initial value: 0.4409
- Final value: 0.4493
- Change: 0.0084 (1.9%)
- Mean: 0.4451
- Std: 0.0042
- Min: 0.4409
- Max: 0.4493

### Interpretation

✅ SUCCESS: η is well preserved (>90% of initial value).

## Next Steps

1. Examine visualizations in slack_signals.png
2. Compare with standard Phase 2 training (with L_recon)
3. Analyze correlation between η and ε
4. Observe Agent C's behavior with preserved slack
