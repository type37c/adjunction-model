# 哲学的理論の調査ノート / Philosophy Research Notes

## 1. SEP: Intention

### Anscombe (1963) - Intention
- 意図の3つの形態: (1) 未来への意図, (2) 行為の意図（intention-with-which）, (3) 意図的行為
- 意図は「進行中であること（being in progress）」の一形態
- 「なぜそれをしているのか？」という問いが意図的行為に適用される
- 意図は静的な心的状態ではなく、行為の進行そのもの

### Bratman (1987) - Intentions as Plans
- 意図は「計画（plan）」としての実践的態度
- 欲求だけでは意図にならない：行為へのコミットメントが必要
- 意図は「行動を制御する賛成的態度（conduct-controlling pro-attitudes）」
- 計画は典型的に部分的（partial）で、変化する状況に応じて埋められる
- 意図の利点: (i) 熟慮できない状況での合理的決定, (ii) 時間的に拡張されたプロジェクトの調整, (iii) 他者との調整
- 意図は手段-目的推論への入力として機能

### Thompson (2008) - Intending as Being in Progress
- 意図は心的状態ではなく、不完全相（imperfectivity）の一形態
- 「目的に向かって進行中であること」が意図の本質
- 進行は極めて初期的・非効果的・中断されたものであっても構わない

### Davidson (1963, 1978) - Primary Reasons
- 意図的行為は「第一理由（primary reason）」によって説明される
- 第一理由 = 行為の特徴Fに対する賛成的態度 + その行為がFを持つという信念
- 純粋な意図（pure intending）は意図的行為に還元できない

### Key Insight for Our Project
- Bratmanの「計画としての意図」: 部分的で、状況に応じて埋められる
- Anscombeの「進行中であること」: 意図は静的状態ではなくプロセス
- Thompsonの「不完全相」: 目的に向かう進行は極めて初期的でもよい

## 2. Heidegger - Being and Time: Equipment, Affordance, and Purposive Structure

### Bewandtnis (Affordance/Involvement/Functionality)
Wrathall translates Bewandtnis as "affordance" — what is basic to available entities is that each affords the doing of particular actions in particular contexts. Available entities "refer" to other entities in a network: a pen affords writing, which sends the user to paper, to desk, to chair. This is the "affordance-and-reference structure."

### In-Order-To (Um-zu) Structure
Circumspection involves "looking around to take in the manifold references of the 'in-order-to'." Equipment is always encountered in terms of what it is FOR — its purpose within a network of references.

### For-the-Sake-of-Which (Worumwillen)
The entire referential network of equipment ultimately terminates in a "for-the-sake-of-which" — Dasein's own possibilities of being. The chain: equipment → in-order-to → for-which → for-the-sake-of-which.

### Key Insight: Affordance is NOT a Property of Objects
"It would be a mistake to understand availableness as a subjective projection of use-properties onto entities that are in themselves 'really' occurrent." Available entities are individuated DIFFERENTLY than occurrent entities. There is no necessary one-to-one correspondence between an affordance and an occurrent object.

### Breakdown and Visibility
Normally, equipment is "transparent" — we don't notice it. Only when it BREAKS DOWN does it become visible as an object (occurrent). This is the transition from readiness-to-hand to presence-at-hand.

### Implications for Purpose Mechanism
Heidegger's structure suggests a HIERARCHICAL purpose architecture:
1. Immediate: in-order-to (use this tool for this task)
2. Intermediate: for-which (this task serves this project)  
3. Ultimate: for-the-sake-of-which (this project serves my way of being)

The purpose is NOT a separate module but is CONSTITUTIVE of how entities are disclosed. Without purpose (the for-the-sake-of-which), entities cannot show up as available/affordable at all.

## 3. Enactivism - Di Paolo, Thompson, Varela

### Autopoiesis and Intrinsic Teleology
Autopoietic systems (self-producing, self-maintaining) generate their own intrinsic teleology. The system's continued existence IS its purpose. This is not externally imposed but emerges from the system's organization.

### Sense-Making
Cognition = sense-making = the process by which an organism creates meaning through its interactions with the environment. Sense-making is inherently evaluative: the organism distinguishes what is good/bad for its continued existence.

### Adaptivity (Di Paolo 2005)
Pure autopoiesis is insufficient for genuine agency. Adaptivity — the capacity to regulate oneself in relation to conditions that are significant for viability — is required. An adaptive system can distinguish between better and worse conditions and ACT to change its situation.

### Key Insight for Purpose Mechanism
Purpose emerges from the system's need to maintain itself (autopoiesis) combined with its capacity to evaluate and regulate its interactions (adaptivity). Purpose is not a separate representation but is embedded in the system's dynamics of self-maintenance and sense-making.

## 4. Gibson - Affordances and Invitations

### Affordances vs Invitations (Reed 1996, Withagen et al. 2012)
There are thousands of affordances in any situation, but most go unnoticed. "Invitations" are the small subset of currently relevant affordances that the agent notices. What makes an affordance become an invitation? The agent's current concerns, needs, and purposes.

### Direct Perception
Affordances are directly perceived, not inferred. Perception and action are tightly coupled. Action generates information for perception, enabling direct perception of affordances.

### Key Insight for Purpose Mechanism
The distinction between affordances (objective possibilities) and invitations (subjectively relevant possibilities) maps directly onto our problem. F/G should capture affordances; the purpose mechanism should determine which affordances become invitations.

## 5. Rietveld & Kiverstein - Skilled Intentionality Framework (SIF)

### Three Perspectives on Affordances
1. **Landscape of affordances** (zoomed out): All affordances available in a form of life. This is the totality of action possibilities.
2. **Local observer perspective** (zoomed in): An individual situated in a concrete situation, coordinating with affordances offered by things and people.
3. **Field of relevant affordances** (lived perspective): The subset of affordances that SOLICIT the individual — that stand out as relevant given current concerns.

### Key Distinction: Landscape vs Field
- **Landscape**: objective, all possibilities (corresponds to F/G's output — all affordances of an object)
- **Field**: subjective, currently relevant possibilities (corresponds to what the purpose mechanism should select)
- What determines the field? The individual's **concerns**, **skills**, and **current situation**

### Skilled Intentionality
Defined as "the selective engagement with multiple affordances simultaneously in a concrete situation." This is NOT deliberate selection but a pre-reflective, embodied responsiveness.

### Tendency Toward Optimal Grip (Merleau-Ponty)
The skilled individual tends toward an "optimal grip" on the situation — a state where the relationship between the individual and the environment is maximally adequate. This is the driving force: not an explicit goal, but a tendency to improve one's grip on the situation.

### Solicitation
Relevant affordances SOLICIT action — they have a motivational character. An affordance becomes a solicitation when it is relevant to the individual's current concerns. The transition from affordance to solicitation is mediated by the individual's skills and concerns.

### Implications for Purpose Mechanism Design
1. Purpose is NOT a fixed goal representation but a DYNAMIC FIELD of concerns
2. The purpose mechanism should function as a FILTER/SELECTOR that transforms the landscape of affordances (F/G output) into a field of relevant affordances
3. This selection is driven by "tendency toward optimal grip" — a general drive to improve the agent-environment fit
4. The mechanism should be PRE-REFLECTIVE — not explicit goal planning but embodied responsiveness

## 6. Merleau-Ponty - Motor Intentionality and Intentional Arc

### Motor Intentionality
The body has its own form of intentionality — "I can" rather than "I think." The body understands the world in terms of what it can DO, not what it can REPRESENT.

### Intentional Arc
"The life of consciousness—cognitive life, the life of desire or perceptual life—is subtended by an 'intentional arc' which projects round about us our past, our future, our human setting, our physical, ideological and moral situation."

The intentional arc is the background that integrates:
- Past experience (sedimented habits)
- Current situation (perceptual field)
- Future possibilities (motor projects)

### Maximum Grip
"Our body is geared into the world when its perception offers it a spectacle as varied and as clearly articulated as possible, and when our motor intentions receive the responses they expect from the world."

The body constantly tends toward "maximum grip" — the optimal relationship between itself and the situation. This is NOT a conscious goal but a pre-reflective tendency.

### Key Insight for Purpose Mechanism
Purpose = tendency toward maximum grip = the pre-reflective drive to optimize the agent-environment relationship. This is not a representation of a goal but a DYNAMICAL TENDENCY embedded in the agent's sensorimotor coupling with the environment.

## 7. Bruineberg & Rietveld (2014) - Self-Organization, Free Energy, and Optimal Grip

### Core Thesis
Skilled intentionality = the organism's tendency toward an optimal grip on a field of affordances. This can be formalized using the Free Energy Principle (FEP).

### Free Energy as "Dis-attunedness"
Free energy is a measure of the "dis-attunedness" between the organism's internal dynamics and the environmental dynamics. Low free energy = well-attuned = good grip. High free energy = poorly attuned = deviation from optimal grip.

### Tendency Toward Optimal Grip = Free Energy Minimization
"The tendency toward an optimal grip could be seen as a consequence of the continuous minimization of free energy through perception and action at the level of the organism as a whole."

### Selective Openness
The organism is not open to ALL affordances but is SELECTIVELY open to relevant ones. This selective openness is shaped by:
1. Action-readiness patterns at multiple timescales
2. The organism's current state and concerns
3. Metastable dynamics that allow flexible switching between action patterns

### Action Readiness Patterns
Internal dynamics should be understood as "affordance-related action-readiness patterns." These are not representations of goals but dynamic states of readiness to respond to specific affordances.

### Key Insight: No Explicit Goals Needed
"During those episodes of skilled activity, the skilled individual does NOT have an explicit goal in mind, but rather is solicited by the environment in such a way as to improve her grip on the situation."

### Deviation from Optimum as Motivation
"What is central to this notion, is that the individual experiences the situation in terms of a DEVIATION from an optimum." This deviation creates a tension to be reduced — this IS the motivation/purpose.

### Critical Connection to Our Project
This maps remarkably well onto our architecture:
- **F/G** → captures the landscape of affordances (environmental structure)
- **η (reconstruction error)** → could function as a measure of "dis-attunedness" (analogous to free energy)
- **Purpose mechanism** → should implement "selective openness" — filtering the landscape into a field of relevant affordances
- **Agent C** → implements action to minimize the deviation from optimal grip

The key insight: PURPOSE IS NOT A SEPARATE REPRESENTATION BUT THE TENDENCY TO MINIMIZE DIS-ATTUNEDNESS (η/free energy). The purpose mechanism should not generate explicit goals but should modulate the agent's sensitivity to different affordances based on the current deviation from optimal grip.

## 8. Synthesis: Philosophical Foundations for Purpose Mechanism Design

### Converging Insights Across Traditions

| Tradition | Key Concept | Purpose Is... | Mechanism |
|-----------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Bratman | Plans as intentions | Hierarchical commitment structure | Means-end reasoning |
| Heidegger | For-the-sake-of-which | Constitutive of how entities appear | Referential totality |
| Merleau-Ponty | Maximum grip | Pre-reflective tendency | Motor intentionality |
| Gibson/Reed | Invitation (vs affordance) | What makes affordances salient | Concerns filter perception |
| Rietveld/Kiverstein | Field of relevant affordances | Selective openness to landscape | Skilled intentionality |
| Bruineberg/Rietveld | Optimal grip = FE minimization | Tendency to reduce dis-attunedness | Self-organization |
| Enactivism | Sense-making | Self-maintenance + adaptivity | Autopoietic organization |

### Three Key Design Principles

1. **Purpose is not a goal representation but a dynamic tendency**: It is the tendency to reduce the deviation from optimal grip (Merleau-Ponty, Bruineberg/Rietveld). In computational terms, this is analogous to free energy minimization.

2. **Purpose transforms the landscape into a field**: It acts as a filter/selector that determines which affordances are currently relevant (Rietveld/Kiverstein). This is not a binary selection but a continuous modulation of salience.

3. **Purpose is hierarchically structured**: From immediate (in-order-to) through intermediate (for-which) to ultimate (for-the-sake-of-which) (Heidegger). Different timescales of action readiness correspond to different levels of this hierarchy.
