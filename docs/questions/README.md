# Key Questions on Adjunction-based AI

This directory archives a series of critical questions raised during the development and theoretical refinement of the adjunction-based AI model. These questions have been instrumental in shaping the core theory and identifying future research directions.

Each document represents a key turning point in the discussion, summarizing the initial question and the resulting theoretical insight.

## Index of Questions

1.  [**Purpose Filter & Slack**](./01_purpose_filter_and_slack.md): Is the agent's purpose filter implicitly contained within the concept of Slack?
2.  [**Adjunction Asymmetry**](./02_adjunction_asymmetry.md): What is the nature of the asymmetry between Shape and Action in the adjunction?
3.  [**Language & Adjunction**](./03_language_and_adjunction.md): How does language relate to the Shape-Action adjunction? Is it another link in the chain, or something else?
4.  [**Theory vs. Architecture Gap**](./04_gap_theory_vs_architecture.md): What is the gap between the theoretical discussion of adjunction and the current architecture?
5.  [**Generality of Slack**](./05_slack_generality.md): Is the Slack model, as implemented, generalizable to a full world model?
6.  [**Context & Affordance**](./06_context_and_affordance.md): How does the architecture handle contextual affordances, like a cup on the edge of a table?
7.  [**Architecture Output**](./07_architecture_output.md): Where does the final output of this architecture emerge, and how do we interact with it?
